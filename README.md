## Work in Progress

A simple implementation of game engine in javascript is done.

Hero and Wumpus Animations and movement is done.

Implementation of A-star Algorithm for enemy AI is done.

Now only need to add win condition, ending screen and updated map. Waiting for Aashir to complete my map.......

I am using free Pixel Art Assets from - [Map](https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset), [Characters](https://merchant-shade.itch.io/16x16-puny-characters).
