This is a HTML5 canvas and Javascript only browser game without any frameworks or libraries. Made as a mini project for AI subject in my college, but also because I like playing games. 

Check this game now here: https://lakshyasharma207-js-game.vercel.app/

The goal of the game is to collect all 20 coins and then escape the dungeon, without getting eaten by wumpus.

The Project is build and bundled using Vite, so after locally downloading the project, do `npm i`, 
then `npm run dev` to start devlopment server or `npm run build` to bundle project before deployment. 
Here I deployed it on vercel directly.

I am using free Pixel Art Assets from - [Map](https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset), [Characters](https://merchant-shade.itch.io/16x16-puny-characters).
