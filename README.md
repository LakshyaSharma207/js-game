This is a HTML5 canvas and Javascript only browser game without any frameworks or libraries. Made as a mini project for AI subject in my college, but also because I like playing games and someday wanted to make my own with a game engine, animations and all (not just cli ones).

#### TODO 
determine escape Vectors and make coins appear at random places.

I am using free Pixel Art Assets from - [Map](https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset), [Characters](https://merchant-shade.itch.io/16x16-puny-characters).
