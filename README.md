This is a HTML5 canvas and Javascript only browser game without any frameworks or libraries. Made as a mini project for AI subject in my college, but also because I like playing games. 

Description: A short top-down game made using HTML5 canvas and javascript, made for exploring and understanding how a generic game engine work as well as how to code enemy AI using algorithms like A-star Pathfinding.

#### TODO 
determine escape Vectors and make coins appear at random places.

I am using free Pixel Art Assets from - [Map](https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset), [Characters](https://merchant-shade.itch.io/16x16-puny-characters).
